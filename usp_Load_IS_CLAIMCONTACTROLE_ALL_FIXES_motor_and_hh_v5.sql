   usp_Load_IS_CLAIMCONTACTROLE  -  v5 (Motor + Household). v5 = household TP pickers pick ONE exposure per CASE (MIN inside the case, BA rule), proc no longer depends on the household exposure table

   RULES USED EVERYWHERE (from the BA transcript, the mapping sheets and the loaded lookup only):
     - ExposureID is filled ONLY when the lookup column Link_to_Exposure = 'YES'. IncidentID ONLY when Link_to_Incident = 'YES'.
     - Third-party roles take the exposure / incident of their OWN TP case. NO claim-level fallback.
     - First-party roles (v2 CHANGE): Motor AD / PA roles take the exposure of THEIR OWN AD / PA case (contact CASEID = case ID, no MIN); Household has no first-party
       exposure link in the lookup (the mandatory claimant is built separately).
     - Nothing is deleted, no row is picked by ROW_NUMBER. A role without a vehicle incident is KEPT with NULL incident / exposure.
     - Mandatory roles logic and PublicID generation are NOT changed.

   v5 SUMMARY: (1) Motor AD and PA: no pick at all (DISTINCT list of the case's own exposure, no unique index). (2) Motor TP: pick inside ONE case only (real split).
               (3) Household TP: pick inside ONE case only (MIN of that case's PublicID) because the BA never described a household split; proc is correct whether HH splits or not.
               (4) Claimant roles are never picked: one claimant row per exposure.
   WHAT CHANGED (search for these names in the code):
     MOTOR + HOUSEHOLD  STEP 2A / 2B  #HH_INCIDENT_BY_TP_CASE and #MOTOR_INCIDENT_BY_TP_CASE = the incident OF THE PICKED EXPOSURE (no independent MIN)
     MOTOR      STEP 2B   #MOTOR_INCIDENT_BY_TP_CASE_VEH  vehicle incident = IS_EXPOSURE_MOTOR.IncidentType = 'VehicleDamage' (no IS_INCIDENT join)
                STEP 2B   #MOTOR_EXPOSURE_BY_TP_CASE_VEH  vehicle exposure of that incident (prefer TP_VEH)
                STEP 3B   #LKP_ROLES_MOTOR ExposureID / IncidentID CASE  (5 roles: repairshop, hirecompany_adm, thirdparty_adm, tpinsurer_Adm, recoveryagent)
                          Hire-versus-vehicle choice is NOT implemented: it is pending BA (the pick stays the lowest incident ID).
     HOUSEHOLD  STEP 2A   #HH_INCIDENT_BY_TP_CASE_VEH     vehicle incident = IS_INCIDENT.Subtype = 'VehicleIncident' (household incidents, third-party CASE exposures only, selected by the PublicID prefix mig:hhtp)
                STEP 2A   #HH_EXPOSURE_BY_TP_CASE_VEH     vehicle exposure of that incident
                STEP 3A   #LKP_ROLES_HH   ExposureID / IncidentID CASE   (3 roles: thirdparty_adm, tpinsurer_Adm, recoveryagent)
                          claim-level fallback REMOVED for third-party roles
     STEP 0 / STEP 6      DROP lines for the new temp tables
   Household claim-level pickers (#HH_EXPOSURE_BY_CLAIM / #HH_INCIDENT_BY_CLAIM) REMOVED: Household first-party roles have no exposure / incident link in the mapping.

       Why: the BA mapping says "if more than one exposure is created from a single V2 case the contact relates to, it is sufficient to link the contact to only one of the exposures".
       The BA transcript explains the split only for Motor (a vehicle+injury TP case = 2 exposures). It says nothing about a household TP case being split, so this proc must not depend on it.
       This one rule is correct in BOTH situations, so the proc is not affected by the household exposure table:
         (a) the table repeats the same PublicID on several rows (today, check H5)  -> MIN returns that same PublicID;
         (b) the table is later fixed to one row per PublicID                      -> MIN returns that PublicID;
         (c) the owner of the household exposure proc confirms a real split (2 PublicIDs for one case) -> the role gets the lowest PublicID (same result on every run), no load failure.
       The mandatory CLAIMANT role does NOT use this picker: it reads every exposure itself, so with a real split each exposure still gets its own claimant row (BA: one claimant record per exposure). */
