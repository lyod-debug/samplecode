   BA EVIDENCE v3 - MOTOR - CLAIM CONTACT ROLES
   - Reads only IS_EXPOSURE_MOTOR, IS_CLAIMCONTACTROLE, IS_CLAIMCONTACT, IS_CLAIM_MASTER, CONTACT_MASTER_MOTOR, lookup.
   - NO dependency on IS_INCIDENT for the BA lists. The incident type comes from IS_EXPOSURE_MOTOR.IncidentType.
     (IS_INCIDENT is used ONLY in the two INTERNAL checks, marked "INTERNAL", never send those to BA.)
   - Each problem case shows ONLY its own exposures and their own incidents.
   - Nothing in usp_Load_IS_CLAIMCONTACTROLE is changed by this file. Nothing is deleted anywhere.

   PART 0  Check IncidentType is filled in IS_EXPOSURE_MOTOR           (run first)
   PART 1  Roles that must link to a vehicle incident, the case has none (per claim / case / role)
   PART 2  Different claim contacts, same role, same exposure (or incident)
   PART 3  Hire checks (4 checks)
   PART 4  INTERNAL: why a TP case has no exposure; exposure incident IDs missing from IS_INCIDENT
   PART 5  How to hold the incident subtype in IS_EXPOSURE_MOTOR (already exists: IncidentType)
   PART 6  FIRST PARTY (AD) and PA ANCILLARY cases - linked by the claim header case ID
   PART 7  Proof that the proc output matches the rule (TP vehicle roles) - run after the proc

   ASSUMED NAMES (verify): IS_EXPOSURE_MOTOR.(Exposure_Motor_PublicID, ClaimID, VectusCaseID_Adm, SourceOrigin_Adm,

   Hire vs normal vehicle incident is told apart with SourceOrigin_Adm ('TP_HIRE' vs 'TP_VEH'), because both are VehicleDamage.

   Only if Part 0 shows NULLs, check the rules table first:                                                         */

   LATER, when you decide to change the claim contact role proc (NOT now): replace its #MOTOR_INCIDENT_BY_CASE_VEH build, which
   joins IS_INCIDENT on Subtype = 'VehicleIncident', with a filter on  EXP.IncidentType = 'VehicleDamage'  taken from the

     Incident: only roles with Link_to_Incident = YES get an incident, and F4 below shows whether any first-party role has that.
   BA rule: if more than one exposure is created, linking to any one of them is enough. These queries show where the claim
   has NONE (role kept, exposure blank) or MORE THAN ONE (the proc takes the lowest ID, nobody decided that).
